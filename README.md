Selling California is the first real-world data science project I ever worked on. I collaborated with three other students with the help of a mentor to analyze and California house pricing data. The notebook displays our EDA, visualizations, ML, and conclusions/ future analysis ideas. 

TWB/Devi Sansthan is a consulting project I worked on with the Data Science Society at Berkeley Social Good committee.
